This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed

`Pandas`

`Numpy`

`Matplotlib`

`Seaborn`

`Sklearn`






Code

Template code is provided in the Capstone Project on Cement data (3) (1).ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use  the xlsx dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to make project better.
